# Demographic & Behavioral Inference Without PII

This repository contains the solution to the problem statement **"Demographic & Behavioral Inference Without PII"** as part of the [Hackathon Name]. The goal of this project is to enable personalization on websites without relying on cookies or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by using machine learning techniques for demographic and behavioral inference.

## ✅ Chosen Problem Statement
**Demographic & Behavioral Inference Without PII**

## 🧠 Problem Understanding
The objective is to create a system that estimates user demographics (e.g., age bracket, affluence) and behavioral personas (e.g., browsing intent, style) based on anonymized behavioral data such as scroll depth, click patterns, session time, and device/browser characteristics. This will enable personalized user experiences without compromising user privacy by using any cookies or PII.

## 🎯 Reason for Choosing This Problem Statement
This problem is highly relevant for several reasons:
- **Rising privacy concerns and regulations** (GDPR, CCPA) demand privacy-first solutions.
- **The phasing out of third-party cookies** across major browsers like Chrome is pushing the industry towards new methods of user personalization.
- We are interested in **ethical machine learning** and **privacy-preserving personalization**.
- The challenge integrates **behavioral psychology**, **data science**, and **privacy-first engineering**, making it both technically rich and impactful.

## 🧩 Approach

### 1. Data Preparation:
- **Behavioral interaction data** such as click rate, dwell time, and scroll depth was used alongside **device metadata** (OS, browser, resolution) to simulate anonymized user behavior.
- The data was processed to reflect real-world anonymized interaction patterns.

### 2. Demographic Inference (Supervised Learning):
- Trained **classification models** like **LightGBM** and **Random Forest** to predict user demographics such as age brackets and affluence levels based on anonymized behavioral signals.
- Synthetic labels and public marketing datasets (e.g., UCI Online Shoppers) were used for training.

### 3. Behavioral Personas (Unsupervised + Heuristics):
- Applied **KMeans clustering** to segment users into personas like **"Window Shopper"**, **"Deal Seeker"**, and **"High-Intent Buyer"**.
- Cluster interpretation was done by analyzing engagement patterns like dwell time, cart behavior, and repeat visits.

### 4. Actionable Mapping:
Mapped the inferred personas to actionable UI/UX suggestions:
- Show reviews for **high-intent users**.
- Offer **discount codes** to **deal seekers**.
- Simplify UI for **mobile-first users**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- **Python** for data manipulation and modeling.
- **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn** for data processing and machine learning.
- **LightGBM** for classification models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizing clusters.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for prototyping.
- **Optional**: **Streamlit** or **Flask** (for real-time inference demos).

## 🔁 Other Approaches Tried
- **Rule-based segmentation** (e.g., dwell time > X → high intent) initially tried, but it lacked generalization and flexibility.
- **Unsupervised clustering** was attempted but didn’t provide enough interpretability, leading to a shift toward a hybrid (semi-supervised) learning approach.

## 🧩 Reason for the Current Approach
- **Scalable and interpretable**: The combination of decision tree-based models and clustering enables explanation of outputs.
- **Privacy-friendly by design**: No cookies or user IDs are used, preserving privacy.
- **Modular architecture**: Easy to integrate into real-time pipelines or analytics layers.

## 📈 Scalability of the Solution
While the solution is not fully scalable in its current form, it has great potential:
- In a production environment, the models could be deployed as **edge inference engines** (e.g., **TensorFlow.js** or **ONNX** in browsers).
- **Federated learning** or **differential privacy** could be incorporated to fine-tune models without centralizing user data.
- Integration with **A/B testing platforms** to test content variations based on inferred personas could further enhance personalization.

### Missing Pieces:
- **Real-time data ingestion pipeline**.
- **Edge deployment pipeline**.
- **Privacy certifications and compliance checks**.

## 📊 Current Status
- **Modeling logic**: ✅ Complete (working inference engine).
- **Clustering/persona mapping**: ✅ Done with visualizations.
- **UI mapping suggestions**: 🟡 Drafted (basic rules based on cluster behavior).
- **Deployment pipeline**: ❌ Not implemented (requires further dev work).

## 💭 Thoughts for the Future
We are excited about the potential of this privacy-preserving solution and see vast applications in **personalization** without compromising user privacy. Further improvements will focus on fine-tuning the models, deploying them at scale, and exploring ways to make the solution even more robust and industry-compliant.
